// Promote the validated candidate to the immutable public version — the ONLY step that writes
// public-facing artifacts. Run after `bake` validates the candidate.
//
// The order makes the immutable base tag the COMMIT POINT, so a mid-promote failure is clean — with one
// documented exception under `--force`, called out at step 3 and in the step-3 abort:
//   1. Refuse if the public version tag already exists — it is immutable; bump to republish (or pass
//      `--force`, wired only to a manual force_republish dispatch, to deliberately regenerate in place).
//   2. Re-validate the candidate (boot + smoke) right now, so the bytes we publish are verified again
//      (the candidate tag is mutable and may have changed since `bake`). Abort on any failure.
//   3. Build each provider's version-named artifact FROM the candidate base (the just-revalidated
//      bytes), so the public artifact provably derives from validated bytes — BEFORE touching the base.
//   3b. Required-providers gate: if `--require`/`REQUIRE_PROVIDERS` names providers a skipped one
//      did not promote (a pure skip is not a `failed`), abort BEFORE the base is written — so the
//      gap can't be detected only post-hoc in bake.ts after the immutable base is already tagged.
//   4. LAST: retag the candidate base → the public version (registry-side). Reached only when every
//      prior step succeeded, so a failure never leaves a published version with missing/stale artifacts.
//
// A PARTIAL promote (`--provider <subset>`, the scoped backfill a dispatch asks for when it adds one
// provider to a version the rest of the fleet already runs) reshapes the same four steps: step 1 wants
// the version to ALREADY exist, steps 2–3 work from the published version base rather than the mutable
// candidate, and step 4 does not happen at all. See {@link PromoteOptions.partial}.
//
// A rerun after a mid-promote failure is clean (the version tag was never written); once published it
// is refused at step 1 — bump the version, or force_republish, to publish again. Under `--force` the
// version's artifacts already exist, and step 3 regenerates them in place: the image retag and e2b
// `template create` publish a new artifact over the old name (the prior one stands until the new one
// lands), but daytona has no snapshot overwrite — it deletes, then creates. So a forced republish whose
// daytona create fails leaves that snapshot ABSENT, not stale. Recovery is a rerun with force_republish
// (a plain rerun is refused at step 1, since the base image is still there).
