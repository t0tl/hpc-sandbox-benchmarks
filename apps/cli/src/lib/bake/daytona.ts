// Bake a Daytona Linux-VM snapshot by uploading the already-built local Docker image to Daytona's
// transient registry, then registering that private image through the SDK. Both public-GHCR paths are
// broken for this valid image: the direct importer returns an opaque inspection error, while the
// declarative builder cannot authenticate its FROM pull. Daytona's CLI local-image path successfully
// uploads the same layers, but hardcodes the `container` sandbox class; our active region is Linux VM
// only. This implements the same documented transient-registry push and explicitly registers
// `SandboxClass.LINUX_VM`. Idempotent: upload first, then delete an existing snapshot of that name and
// recreate it. The API key + runner target come from config.daytona (single-region:
// DAYTONA_API_KEY + DAYTONA_TARGET, e.g. us-west-2).
//
// Delete-then-create is idempotent but NOT atomic: the SDK exposes no snapshot rename or overwrite,
// so the name is unavoidably ABSENT between the delete and a successful create. Reruns converge, but
// a create that fails leaves no snapshot of that name at all. That is harmless for the candidate
// (nothing consumes it) and destructive for a name already in public use — see `promote --force`,
// which is the only caller that hands us a published name. `bakeDaytonaSnapshot` therefore reports
// which side of the delete it failed on, so callers never have to guess whether the name survived.
//
// Iteration surface: a snapshot's region must match where sandboxes boot. We pass the client `target`;
// if the target also needs an explicit snapshot `regionId`, add it to CreateSnapshotParams here.
//
// Dual-class: this bakes BOTH isolation variants. Snapshot registration pins the class explicitly
// (`DaytonaBakeOptions.sandboxClass`) rather than relying on the transient-push API's container
// default — daytona-vm bakes SandboxClass.LINUX_VM in us-west-2, daytona-container bakes
// SandboxClass.CONTAINER in the same region. The class is a property of the snapshot, so the two variants
// are necessarily separate snapshots.
