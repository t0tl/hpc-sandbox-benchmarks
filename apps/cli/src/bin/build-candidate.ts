// `build-candidate` — the BUILD phase of the toolchain release: build the base image (+ variants) and
// push the mutable candidate base to GHCR ONCE, then resolve and record its immutable digest. Split
// from the provider bake so the image is built a single time here and every provider cell fans out
// from the already-pushed candidate ref (build once, fan out). The local iteration loop still uses
// `bake --build-push` (which build-pushes AND bakes in one process); CI splits the two.
//
// This script has ONE mode: it always rebuilds the base. The `build` dispatch input's other value,
// `skip`, is resolved a phase earlier by the plan skipping this job outright, so it never reaches
// here — a scoped backfill derives its artifacts from the already-published base and needs no build.
//
// Emits, in one invocation:
//   • the `key=value` step outputs (base digest + digest-pinned ref) straight to $GITHUB_OUTPUT
//     via emitStepOutputs — NOT to stdout: build.sh runs with inherited stdout, so a
//     `bun … >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"` redirect would splice build.sh's progress into the outputs file and
//     GitHub would reject it. stdout is left to carry the (inherited) build log, and
//   • argv[1] (optional): a build-metadata.json diagnostic artifact with the same facts.
