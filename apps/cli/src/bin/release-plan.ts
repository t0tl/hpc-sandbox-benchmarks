// `release-plan` — the FIRST job of the toolchain release. Resolve the toolchain identity from the
// arktype-validated config, decide the release mode, and emit ONE machine-checkable release plan that
// every downstream job (build, the provider bake matrix, promote) consumes instead of re-deriving the
// refs and gates from the raw workflow inputs (the "make the plan an artifact" contract).
//
// Two outputs, one invocation:
//   • the full plan as pretty JSON, written to the path in argv[1] (uploaded as the release-plan.json
//     diagnostic artifact), and
//   • the consumed `key=value` lines written straight to $GITHUB_OUTPUT (skip, mode, matrix, refs, …)
//     via emitStepOutputs — never a stdout redirect, so no subprocess chatter can corrupt them.
//
// Credential posture: importing `config`/`validatedPins` validates env + pins with NO cloud creds
// (the fail-fast gate). The one privileged call is the immutability probe (`imageExistsInRegistry`,
// a `docker manifest inspect` that needs the GHCR login the plan job does first). That probe is only
// a best-effort EARLY skip — the authoritative immutable-version guard lives in `promote` (which
// REFUSES on an uncertain check), so an inconclusive probe here proceeds rather than blocks.
