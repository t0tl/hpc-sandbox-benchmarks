/**
 * All provider benchmark configurations: each schema provider's identity joined with its harness
 * adapter, in schema declaration order.
 *
 * No runtime reconciliation is needed because both sides are keyed by the same `ProviderId`:
 * `PROVIDERS` is derived from the schema's `Record<ProviderId, …>` registry and `adapters` is a
 * `Record<ProviderId, ProviderAdapter>`, so every `meta.id` indexes exactly one adapter and the two
 * registries are provably the same set at compile time.
 *
 * The runtime {@link assertProviderJoin} below backs that compile-time guarantee for any path the
 * type-checker never saw — a published/installed build or a cross-version schema/providers drift —
 * failing loudly at module load rather than letting a one-sided provider surface as an `undefined`
 * adapter mid-run.
