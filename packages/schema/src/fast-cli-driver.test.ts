/**
 * Subprocess gate for the fast-cli driver embedded in pts-profiles/fast-cli-1.0.0/install.sh (the
 * fast-driver.mjs heredoc). The driver under test is extracted VERBATIM from the shipped install.sh --
 * never a duplicate copy -- so these scenarios exercise exactly what runs on providers. Each scenario
 * stages a temp dir holding the driver plus scripted mocks of the two fast-cli 5.2.0 modules the driver
 * resolves relative to itself, spawns the driver, and asserts on its stdout JSON, its
 * `fast-cli: stop=...` stderr line, and its exit code. No network, no Chrome.
 *
 * Pinned regression (P1, run 29799034615): fast.com renders #bufferbloat-value DURING the download
 * phase, so a settle predicate gated on bufferbloat-hold alone finalized trials whose upload phase never
 * started (uploadSpeed=0 labeled "settle" at the backstop ceiling) or was still ramping (banked mid-ramp
 * garbage with exit 0). Settle may only fire once the upload max has been stable for SETTLE_MS, and
 * never at/after the backstop instant.
 *
 * Timing notes: POLL_MS is hardcoded at 500ms in the driver, so the scaled-down SETTLE_MS must exceed
 * one tick, and elapsed-time assertions carry generous slack. FAST_CLI_MEM_STOP_PCT=99 is REQUIRED: on
 * Linux CI the /proc/meminfo fallback reports a real fraction of host memory (it is only inert on hosts
 * without /proc/meminfo), so the 60% default could trip on a loaded runner and flake every scenario; 99
 * keeps the watchdog armed but unreachable.
