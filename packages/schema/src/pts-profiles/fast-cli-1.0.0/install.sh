# We drive fast-cli's browser generator ourselves instead of running its `cli.js`, because that CLI has
# two failure modes that made every trial on every provider run to the outer watchdog (~850s/suite) and,
# on the faster paths, OOM the sandbox:
#
#   1. It emits its JSON and returns ONLY once fast.com flips the measurement to "succeeded". fast.com
#      keeps ramping until it is confident, and on a fast datacenter->Netflix path (multi-Gbps) that means
#      Chrome buffers in-flight download/upload bytes faster than fast.com's page consumes them; a single
#      renderer climbs past ~3.5 GiB and the cgroup OOM-killer reaps it (blaxel: 2 kills / 0 metrics;
#      novita: 1 kill / JSON truncated to 2 metrics), or the exec pipe wedges (daytona). The RAM-backed
#      root fs on the 8 GiB spec makes it worse — those buffers are counted twice.
#   2. Even when it DOES converge, cli.js closes the browser via `await browser.close()` in a `finally`.
#      In these minimal headless sandboxes that close never returns, so a trial that already measured
#      cleanly still hangs until the watchdog SIGKILLs it (confirmed: modal/e2b wrote perfect JSON yet
#      both trials still burned the full ~420s).
#
# An earlier fix bounded (1) with a fixed 90s wall-clock deadline. That stopped the OOMs and hangs but
# swapped them for unreliable numbers: 90s lands mid-ramp, before fast.com's convergence, so the driver
# banked whatever transient was on the page (e2b: 0.67 Mbps download next to an 830 Mbps upload; novita
# download swinging 14 -> 230 Mbps between trials). The page's #speed-value is also re-purposed once the
# upload phase starts, so reading download at the END of the run captured a cleared value, not the result.
#
# This driver instead bounds MEMORY, not time, so a healthy path runs to fast.com's real convergence:
#   * A cgroup-aware watchdog samples the SAME accounting the OOM-killer uses (memory.current vs
#     memory.max, minus reclaimable file cache) and stops the trial once usage crosses a safe fraction of
#     the limit — well below the kill threshold. /proc/meminfo is only a last-resort fallback because on
#     these sandboxes it reports the 755 GiB HOST, not the 8 GiB cgroup limit, and would never trip.
#   * A trial stopped by that watchdog (or by the long absolute backstop) is a genuine failure to measure,
#     so it exits nonzero and PTS records a failed trial instead of banking a truncated row.
#   * The download plateau is latched WHILE the upload phase is still zero, so the end-of-run re-purposing
#     of #speed-value can no longer zero it out.
#   * Completion is fast.com's own `succeeded`/isDone signal OR a stability fallback. The fallback exists
#     because on the fastest paths fast.com never flips the `succeeded` class, and gating on isDone alone
#     would fail providers that are in fact measuring cleanly. Bufferbloat-hold alone is NOT finality:
#     fast.com renders #bufferbloat-value DURING the download phase, ~10s before the first upload byte on
#     a healthy path (live probes 2026-07-21: bufferbloat positive at ~5-6s, upload first positive at
#     ~15-17s; the 29799034615 trials showed bufferbloat 6-11 with uploaded:0). So the fallback requires
#     the upload phase to have started AND its displayed max to have been stable for SETTLE_MS, on top of
#     the bufferbloat hold and MIN_MS, and only before the backstop instant. A run whose upload never
#     starts or never stabilizes runs to BACKSTOP_MS and exits 1 as a failed trial (the designed
#     failed-measurement shape).
#
# The generator is read by hand (never `for await`, whose implicit break would call the generator's
# .return() and trigger the hanging browser.close()); the driver then HARD-exits without closing the
# browser and the launcher below reaps the orphaned Chrome.
#
# UNGATED. The driver below used to carry a subprocess test (schema/src/fast-cli-driver.test.ts) that
# extracted this heredoc verbatim and replayed scripted fast.com yields through it, pinning the settle
# rules against the P1 in run 29799034615. It was deleted: the network SUITE measures WAN throughput
# via iperf3 (see schema/src/suites.ts), this profile is manual-only, and the gate's seven scripted
# scenarios ran to real wall-clock timers for ~5s of every test run. Nothing now checks the settle
# logic, so edit the stop rules below with the failure modes documented above in hand — or restore the
# gate from git history first (it is intact, and re-extracts this heredoc by its DRIVER_EOF markers).
