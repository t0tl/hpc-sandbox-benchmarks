/**
 * Render a validated {@link Run} into the public comparison surface: one ranked table per emitted,
 * catalogued Metric, grouped by Dimension. This is the payoff the dataset exists for — a complete,
 * human-readable provider ranking. SDK-free: the Run model + the Catalog only.
 *
 * Each Dimension shows every Metric that at least one provider produced, with its headline Metric
 * first (catalog.ts guarantees at most one), and every provider that produced each Metric ranked by
 * its Direction (HIB → highest first, LIB → lowest first). A Metric with no provider value is omitted.
 * The representative value is the Samples' p50 (median) — robust to a single slow pass.
 *
 * The document leads with `realworld` and collapses the synthetic microbenchmarks, because that is the
 * claim this benchmark makes: a synthetic score says what the hardware CAN do, and the real-world
 * workflows say what a developer or a CI job actually waits on. See {@link LEADERBOARD_DIMENSION_ORDER}
 * and {@link SYNTHETIC_DIMENSIONS}. Which sections exist stays driven by the data — a Dimension no
 * provider emitted is absent, collapsed or not.
 *
 * Ranking is INFERENTIAL, not a bare sort, and the unit it reasons about is the SANDBOX. A provider is
 * measured on R independent sandboxes, each running k trials; trials capture within-machine noise while
 * sandboxes capture the machine-to-machine variation a user meets on every fresh environment. Ordering
 * on a median alone would let a lucky draw buy a position: a live run had modal's STREAM Copy span
 * 9.7k–65k MB/s against daytona's 66.5k ±0.14%. So each row carries a cluster-bootstrapped interval
 * around the median of its per-sandbox medians, and two rows share a rank unless their per-sandbox
 * medians separate under Mann-Whitney U (with Kolmogorov-Smirnov reported alongside, since a bimodal
 * provider can match another's median while behaving nothing like it).
